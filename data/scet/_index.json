Department was started from the very first year of the inception of Institute in 1995. Chemical Engineering Department of SCET was accredited by NBA in 2006. The department zealously strives to provide students, the exposure to industrial environment by way of Industrial training, expert lectures and Plant visits. Seminars and workshops are organized frequently to hone their technical and soft skills. The students undergo an extensive course work and extensive laboratory practice in all conventional and advanced areas of Chemical Engineering. In addition, students are involved in significant number of Industry projects where they get a chance to solve problem from Industry and interact with their future employers. As SCET is located in the heart of one of the Chemical hubs of the state, Chemical Engineering students get a chance to interact with local chemical companies and get connected through summer internships and regular plant visits to industries in the vicinity of the city and state. Also there are many students who opt for higher studies at Universities in India and abroad. In order to enhance the knowledge and develop research cult in faculties as well as students different National level events such as National Conference, Symposiums and Short term training programs are organized on the regular basis.\n\nTo be a centre of excellence in Chemical Engineering education and research which is industrially relevant and globally competitive.\n\n1. To augment student performance by providing advanced technical knowledge and excellent laboratory infrastructure. 2. To enhance field exposure and research through interaction with public/private sectors and alumni. 3. To create professionals inculcated with innovative ethical thinking, scientific approach and collectively contribute to a society at large.\n\n1. The chief aim of the course is to improve the student\u2019s knowledge in the field of unit operations and unit processes applied in chemical industries, its commissioning and implementation. 2. Enhance the student\u2019s skills in the field of manufacturing of chemicals and identifying-solving major engineering problems associated with it thereby developing them professionally. 3. Cultivate analytical thinking and thereby increase their adaptability of students for changing and upgrading technologies. 4. Provide overall development of the students so that they are able to pursue higher studies, become entrepreneurs or work in harmony with the industries. 5.
