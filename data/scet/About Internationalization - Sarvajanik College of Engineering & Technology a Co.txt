About the International Relations Cell

To achieve technological excellence in Engineering education, the International Relations Cell (IR Cell) aims to promote intensive academic and research partnerships and collaborations with leading higher education institutes, universities and industries across the globe. The primary objective of such International partnerships and collaborations is to provide our students with the most enriching global academic exposure to bridge the global knowledge gap.  IR Cell creates avenues of opportunities for students by organising a wide range of events like Student Exchange Programs, Internship in Foreign Organizations, Global Excursions, Summer Schools in Foreign Universities, and many more with an intent to amplify our academic rigor and cultural wisdom. Through such events, our students get the unique opportunity to learn from eminent professors and universities abroad.  Such events not only bring more cross-cultural work exposure and global opportunities to students, but also enhance their global professional network.

The key objectives of IR Cell are:

To promote relationships with foreign institutes and organizations through strategic partnerships.
